Saft
====

**Saft is an unobtrusive tool for rapid publishing; drop a file: Voil√†!**
It transforms image, video and plain text files into Web documents without the use of a database. The static nature of Saft combined with a sly caching makes it super fast and very secure. See the [project page](http://doogvaard.net/speelplaats/2011/07/04/saft/) for more information.

If you prefer to manage your content using a Web browser, then check out [Maat](https://github.com/bingobongo/maat). It is built for that purpose.
